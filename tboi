#***NOTE*** This is the hardest part of the program. What's happening here is we have to compute all of the possible ways you can succeed
#in a fight. However, this isn't as easy as using factorials and combinatorics, as you will double count a lot of already considered
#possibilities, which skews the probability. To see how this line works, consider:
#
#You: 4 Health, 1 damage
#Monster: 7 Health, 1 damage, 5+ on dice roll.
#
#To calculate these odds, we need to add the probabilities of not failing a single dice roll, failing once, failing twice, and failing
#3 times. Notice that if we fail 4 times, the combat is over, and we want to compute the odds of a *successful* attack. So, to begin,
#we compute the odds of not missing a single attack, which in this case would be (1/3)^7. Now, we need to compute the odds of winning,
#assuming you failed once. To do this, we can look at all of the possibilitiesof 5c1 (5 choose 1), which are as follows:
# FSSSS
# SFSSS
# SSFSS
# SSSFS
# SSSSF
#But, notice that last entry has a failed dice roll at the end. We need to throw this value out as we have already rolled 4 successful
#dice rolls, and thus do not need to roll a 5th time. So, the probability of rolling 4 successful rolls with 1 failed roll is:
#5*(1/3^7)*(2/3)
#Continuing on with the pattern, let us consider the possibility of rolling 4 successful rolls with 2 failed rolls. To do this, we need to
#consider 6c2. Which is listed below.
#FFSSSS
#FSFSSS
#FSSFSS
#FSSSFS
#FSSSSF *
#SFFSSS
#SFSFSS
#SFSSFS
#SFSSSF *
#SSFFSS
#SSFSFS
#SSFSSF *
#SSSFFS
#SSSFSF *
#SSSSFF *
#If you were to count these, you'd see that there are 15 outcomes. However, notice each entry marked with an *. These are all of the entries
#that ended with a failed dice roll, and thus would not occur, as they have already been accounted for in previous cases (those being successful
#attacks with no failures, and successful attacks with 1 failure.). So, we throw them out. This trend continues as you increase the amount
#of chances you have to take damageand not die. Now the question becomes, "how do we know how many entries to throw out in each iteration?"
#After looking at different cases and seeking counsel, I had come up with the original equation used in the code. If we take the example we used
#above, and expand each iteration out to match forms, we have:
#
#0 fail(s): (7c0)*(1/3^7)*(2/3)^0
#1 fail(s): (8c1 - 7c7)*(1/3^7)*(2/3)^1
#2 fail(s): (9c2 - 8c7)*(1/3^7)*(2/3)^2
#3 fail(s): (10c3 - 9c7)*(1/3^7)*(2/3)^3
#
#From this example, it is easier to see how the equation used in the code is implemented. Note that we do not consider 4 failures as that would
#result in the death of our charatcer.
