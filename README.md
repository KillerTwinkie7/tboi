A program to spit out probabilities of successful attacks in the card game The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls. Likely has applications in other board/card games with heavy empahsis on dice rolls.

I've had this updated for a while now, but forgot to upload the finalized version. Not only does this new version have GUI. it can also account for Curse of the Tower and Guppy's Collar. I won't be working to implement other cards, as I realized how big the card pool is shortly after I had finished the project, and didn't want to commit my life to something about 7 people will actually see. Enjoy!
