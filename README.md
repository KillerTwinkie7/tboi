# tboi
A program to spit out probabilities of successful attacks in the card game The Binding of Isaac: Four Souls. Likely has applications in other board/card games with heavy empahsis on dice rolls.

I've had this updated for a while now, but forgot to upload the finalized version. Not only does this new version have GUI. it can also account for Curse of the Tower and Guppy's Collar. I won't be working to implement other cards, as I realized how big the card pool is shortly after I had finished the project, and didn't want to commit my life to something about 7 people will actually see.

The file "tboi" is the old version with no GUI, and "tboi.py" is the new, updated version. There's no realistic reason you'd want the old one, but it's there on the off chance whatever project you're working on is more closely resembled to it rather than the spaghetti of the newer version. But y'know, if it works, it works.
